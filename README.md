experiments with testing web sites
#How I approached it
For long time I wanted to try again web atutomation, and finally it happens :)

1. I started with a [plan](Docs/Tasks plan.md) to estimate types of tasks and how much time I need to spend on them
2. Than I created high-level checklist of elements that presented on [SUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_under_test). This is important for me to visualise scope of work and have model of future tests
3. Gradually I extended check-list with more detailed checks (edge cases, negative tests)
4. Finally I created high-level test scenarios, which will be UberSmoke, Smoke and Regression tests.
5. I did quick research and selected tool, language and framework for future tests. [Notes on reasoning for selection](Docs/Selection of tools.md)
6. Than I setup [environment for development](Docs/Environment setup.md) 
7. Than I setup [tests framework ](Docs/Framework setup.md)
8.
